/*

You have the following array:
const int SIZE = 5;
int numbers [SIZE] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

Write the following programs :

1. Printing the Contents of the Array (Both with tradition for-Loop anh C++ range-based for-Loop)

2. Summing the Values in the numbers Array (Both with tradition for-Loop anh C++ range-based for-Loop)

3. Getting the Average of the Values in the numbers Array (Both with tradition for-Loop anh C++ range-based for-Loop)

4. Finding the Highest Value in the numbers Array (Both with tradition for-Loop anh C++ range-based for-Loop)

5. Finding the Lowest Value in the numbers Array (Both with tradition for-Loop anh C++ range-based for-Loop)

6. Write a program that compares the following two array
int firstArray[] = { 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 };
int secondArray[] = { 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 };

if each element in firstArray is equal to each element in secondA rray
then print "The arrays are the same."

otherwise print "The arrays are not the same."
